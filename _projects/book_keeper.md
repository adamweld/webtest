I like to bring my notebook with me everywhere, and often throw it in my backpack with whatever else happens to be inside. Unfortunately, this sometimes resulted in bent pages, when the book opened inside the pack.

I designed this sleeve to keep my notebook closed and thus protected; it also holds a pen or pencil.

I use one of my favorite flexible filaments, [TPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoplastic_polyurethane), to achieve just the right amount of friction while still being easy to slide on and off. I've found TPU to be extremely strong and resiliant - while I use this print every day, it has lasted over two years and still looks as good as new.
