While still in high school, I interned at Dieter Fox's [Robotics and State Estimation Lab](http://rse-lab.cs.washington.edu/) at the university of washington.

I was lucky enough to meet post-doc [Andrzej Pronobis](https://www.pronobis.pro/) and work with him on research in semantic mapping.

I took on the design of the mechanical structure, assisted with sensor selection and placement, and worked on some of the ROS code and system integration.

You can find [more information about the project](https://www.pronobis.pro/projects/semantic_mapping/) and the [IEEE RA Paper](https://www.pronobis.pro/publications/pronobis2012icra.pdf)
