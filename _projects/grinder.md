I designed these modification parts for my father's coffee grinder, which out of the box was spectacular at getting grounds all over the place.

The 3D printed guard ensures that most of the coffee makes it into the portafilter, while the redesigned tray is larger than the stock tray and snaps reliably into place with long printed flexures.

The original tray broke where it snapped into the grinder; these extended flexures allow for a more secure connection while reducing strain. All in all this version should last much longer than the one that came with the grinder.
