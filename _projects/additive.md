## Additive Manufacturing
When I first discovered 3D printing back in 2009, I thought them interchangeable with magic. The ability to instantiate any design in physical form, in a few hours - what an incredible capability!

Of course, the truth is much more nuanced. In the decade I've spent working with 3D printers and designing for additive manufacture, I've learned that these machine sare truly amazing for some use cases, and highly flawed in other cases. In the three years I spent managing the Cornell Rapid Prototyping Lab (RPL), I saw thousands of parts printed that never should have made it past the drawing table. Fundamentally, I've found that knowing intimately the capabilities and gotchas of the machine you are using, and designing your part with those limitiations in the front of your mind, is crucial for achieving good performance with 3D printed parts.

Below you will find a few of my projects and thoughts on Additive Manufacturing.


### Grinder Guard & Tray
I designed these modification parts for my father's coffee grinder, which out of the box was spectacular at getting grounds all over the place. The 3D printed guard ensures that most of the coffee makes it into the portafilter, while the redesigned tray is larger than the stock tray and snaps reliably into place with long printed flexures. 

### Book Keeper
This is a design I use every day to keep my notebook securely closed in my backpack. It also holds a pen or pencil.

Just another reminder that TPU is a great material, this print has lasted over two years and still looks good as new.

### S Hook Retainer
Another quick TPU fix-it print, this small device keeps simple S-hooks from falling off of the rack when jostled.


### Duplicate Keys
One of my proudest moments of procrastination: I spent an hour or so measuring each feature of the original key precisely with calipers, created a CAD model, and then printed it out. Yes, these actually worked.
