This three degree-of-freedom stewart platform, named "Stewy", was a final project built for Bruce Land's [microcontrollers class](http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/). I took care of component selection, mechanical design, and the algorithm that controlled the stepper motors.

The platform was set up to mirror the attitude of a goat-shaped controller. The controller doubled as a mascot for our team, which we had previously dubbed the [microgoats](https://microgoats.life).

The project's report/website can be found [here](http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/f2017/psl58_aw698_eb645/psl58_aw698_eb645/index.html).
